# Space Invaders

## Requirment 
- Game has at least one level
- Game has a controllable character/object
- Players have a  main objective / end goal
- Inserts assets/images in order to add some stylistic elements
- Optional
  - [Advanced] Test your game using ML! - Add extra functionality to get your game to be its best possible self!

## Design of the game

##### Consider the following: 
- Is this reasonable to create within the timeframe?
- What will be implemented in order to create a successful product?
- Start to prioritize and create a checklist of things to focus on as a group
  
##### Details of the Game
- Movement of the aliens and the player, both the player and the aliens move left to right
- Aliens move down a row every time they reach the end of the screen
- Player shoots projectiles upwards every time a key is pressed
- Maybe set the space button to be the key that fires the projectiles
- Arrow keys/WASD to move the character around the display ( we can also make it so we can control the character with our mouse)
- Power-ups in the game that increases movement speed and bullet speed
- Work of the game could be split up into four parts
- Maybe include a multiplayer function up to 2 players
- we can give the player 3 lives

## List of jobs

### Details
- Movement: two people can work on this part, one person codes the movement of the player, the other codes the movement of the aliens

- (Anyone can code the defense blocker, the defense blockers would have to be displayed and then each time it is hit by either an alien or player, a chuck surrounding the spot that was hit will vanish)

- Score calculation + live system: someone could calculate the score each time an alien is hit and the lives the player has

- Maps and sprites for the characters: Costumes for the player and alien, making the map
  
- Game over + GUIs, live system: Game over functions as well as the start menu. Have an option to restart the game
  
### Jobs
- Movement of player - Neha - Power-ups
- Movement of alien - Tak -  Faster alien movement, Alien health bar change
- Score core calculation + lives calculation - kemi - each level alien health increases by 5 or 10 idk, aliens worth more points as the player moves through levels 
- Maps and sprites - Michael - Map-making and character design
- Game over + GUIs -  AJ - Main menu w/ restart options
